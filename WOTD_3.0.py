# Key Changes:
# Error Handling: Added try-except blocks in the send_sms and send_email functions to catch and report errors.
# Email Functionality: The send_email function sends an email with the word of the day.
# Scheduling: The program is set up to run the main function daily at 09:00. You can adjust the time as needed.
# Documentation: Added docstrings to functions to explain their purpose.
# Next Steps:
# Replace the placeholder values in the constants section with your actual Twilio and email credentials.
# Test the code to ensure everything is working as expected.
